* Solve the assessment in this order:

```
bundle exec rspec spec/deck_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/hand_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/player_spec.rb
```

  but no specs for it.

* Wait until you finish to run `rspec spec`, which will run all the
  tests. Do this as a final check that you have them all passing.
