# a/A Practice Test Generator

**How to use this generator**

1. Clone this repo

2. Navigate to the folder in terminal and run
`ruby generator.rb`

3. Input your practice test requests in the form `category: # of problems`

4. You will now have three new files: `practice_test.rb`, `spec.rb` and `solutions.rb`. These should be self explanatory. Run `bundle exec rspec spec.rb` to test your answers against the spec as you work through the practice assessment. 

**Submit more problems!**
Create the problem, spec and solution files, add them to their respective folders, and add their names to the `list.csv` file
